# Fitness-Tracker

## Code

This application is used to keep track of fitness workouts. The workouts can either be cardio or resistance training. 
The front end was completed by a third party, but I was contracted to write the backend code. MongoDB and Mongoose were used to create a database
which keeps track of user information. Express.js was used for html routing and database routing to enter and extract the necessary data. The front
end code had to be analyzed in order to comprehend what needed to be done on the backend. A custom method was added to obtain the total workout duration.
